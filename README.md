# Fan_ESP8266_Homekit

A simple project that allows for a fan to be controlled by an ESP8266 unit.

# This is a work in progress, I am hoping to have it finished soon with pictures and videos to help!

## Notes
- Pin 2 controls a relay that allows for the fan to change states from on to off
- This is for a on/off state fan


### NB: This project requires the use of the units EMPROM.
- THis might mean depending on the unit you are using that you might have to change where the data is stored.
- The reason for this... We have loadshedding and without this addon, my fan would switch off from lack of power and then remain off even if the power comes back on.
